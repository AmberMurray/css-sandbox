CSS Sandbox was designed to give folks a place to play with CSS.  If you've ever thought CSS wasn't for you, or if you just wondered about the native functionality of CSS - come play in the Sandbox!  Change font colors, learn how animations work, or design a button to use in your own project.

Check it out here: https://csssandbox.herokuapp.com/

You are also welcome to fork and/or clone this repo. Run npm install from the command line to download all the fun! Open the app in any browser via http://localhost:3000/ (or the port of your choice). Enjoy!


# Features
The Sandbox features dropdown lists for animations, buttons, and forms.  




# Food Truck Info
See all the important details for a particular truck in one place.  Each bar listed in the "Bar's I'm Visiting Today" table is a link to a local watering hole. Read the opinion of other food truck foodies and contribute your two cents.
