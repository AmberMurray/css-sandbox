# CSS Sandbox

CSS Sandbox was designed to give folks a place to play with CSS.  If you've ever thought CSS wasn't for you, or if you just wondered about the native functionality of CSS - come play in the Sandbox!  Change font colors, learn how animations work, or design a button to use in your own project.

You are also welcome to fork and/or clone this repo. Run npm install from the command line to download all the fun! Open the app in any browser via http://localhost:3000/ (or the port of your choice). Enjoy!


# Features
The Sandbox features dropdown lists for animations, buttons, and forms, a display, and a code editor.

Once you make a selection, you'll see your choice in real-time in the display, and you can view the code in the editor.  Make changes to the code, press submit, and presto! - you've created your own custom CSS Code!

CSS Sandbox was created using only CSS, so you can copy and paste the code directly into your own stylesheet.  Change the class name to your liking and apply it to your favorite element.  Congratulations - you are now a CSS Master!
